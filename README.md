carlsbadnmtransit
=================

This is a project to create a [GTFS dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Transit_Feed_Specification) for the [Carlsbad, New Mexico Transit System](http://cityofcarlsbadnm.com/transit.cfm).

- `/gtfs-odbl/` contains GTFS formatted files and an example zipped file, with geospatial data under ODbL license (c) OpenStreetMap contributors and other data released to Public Domain. Route paths still need to be uploaded from personal notes.


The latest odbl zipped file is available at https://github.com/ethan-nelson/carlsbadnmtransit/raw/master/gtfs-odbl/carlsbadtransit-odbl.zip.

This information was originally collected by personal survey and collaboration with the City of Carlsbad Municipal Transit System office.

Using https://github.com/google/transitfeed, the project files have been verified to meet the GTFS standards.
